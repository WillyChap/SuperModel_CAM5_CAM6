# SuperModel_CAM5_CAM6


This is a repo to run the CAM5/CAM6 super model with CYLC. 

First: 

### Change all the path names in: 
./init_models 
./cylc/super_cam5cam6/
./Peudo_obs_files/*

-- you should be able to just search and replace "wchapman"


First run:

bash init_model.sh


then run the cylc process: 

'HOW TO RUN CYLC' should give you some steps to do so... the syntax is weird.
